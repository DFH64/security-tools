# Basic Unix Cracker
Very basic password cracking utility made just for fun. Uses the standard `crypt` module for salting and unhashing passwords. I doubt this would even be viable on many systems today, but if you decide to use it for education, you need to provide a dictionary and a passwords file. A good place to get a free dictionary file from is CrackStation's Password Cracking Dictionary. Available at https://crackstation.net/buy-crackstation-wordlist-password-cracking-dictionary.htm
If you do manage to cause any harm with this tool or anything I upload to my GitHub, YOU are responsible. Not me.
